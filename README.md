# Neuromorphic Target Detection

Contains source code to import recorded data from jAER to MATLAB, DAVIS simulator (python), ASSET, DVS/DAVIS software Modeling produced specifically for this project, and MATLAB scripts developed to filter and process event data for ISR applications.

# MATLAB import from jAER

Scripts available at https://sourceforge.net/p/jaer/code/HEAD/tree/scripts/matlab/ and https://github.com/gorchard/Matlab_AER_vision_functions

# DAVIS Simulator

Source code for DAVIS Simulator in python, also available at https://github.com/uzh-rpg/rpg_davis_simulator.

# ASSET 

ASSET source code is provided here to aid in developing a physics based DVS/DAVIS model on representative ISR scenes

# DVS/DAVIS software Modeling

MATLAB code produced specifically for modeling the expected performance of a DVS/DAVIS sensor to a scene with appropriate, phenomenologically informed parameters applied to the sensor

# Event Filters and Tracking Algorithms

MATLAB code developed specifically for applications related to target detection and tracking with DVS/DAVIS prototypes.
