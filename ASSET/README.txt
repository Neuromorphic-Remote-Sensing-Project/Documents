# AFIT Sensor & Scene Emulation Tool (ASSET)

## Distribution
DISTRIBUTION C. Distribution authorized to U.S. Government Agencies and their contractors; Critical Technology; 07 December 2017. Other request for this document shall be referred to AFIT/CTISR, 2950 Hobson Way, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH 45433

Refer to DoD Directive 5230.9 and any applicable security classification guides for guidance on distribution of data and other products generated by ASSET prior to distribution.

ASSET may be obtained from:
  1. https://gitlab.radiancetech.com/CTISR/ASSET/
  2. https://bitbucket.di2e.net/projects/AFIT/repos/ASSET

## License
ASSET and its products are are subject to the terms and conditions of the AFIT Sensor & Scene Emulation Tool (ASSET) License Agreement. 
  
## Dependencies
ASSET has been tested on Windows 7, Windows 10, and MAC OS X and is compatible with Matlab R2015a and later. Mathworks inplemented a new graphics system in R2014b which is likely not compatible with ASSET.

Matlab’s Image Processing Toolbox is required for interactively adjusting scene and sensor geometry. This is optional functionallity and the toolbox is not absolutely required. Its use may be disabled by setting `Prompt = FALSE` in the configuration file located at `[ASSET root directory]\default\Default.cfg` in addition to any other configuration files that explicitly include the `Prompt` parameter.

If ASSET is obtained from Gitlab or Bitbucket, the Git LFS (Large File Storage) extension is required. LFS replaces large files with pointers, and downloading ASSET via the web interface or without Git LFS installed will result in necessary support files not being acquired.

Instructions:
  1. Download and install Git (https://git-scm.com/downloads) and Git LFS (https://git-lfs.github.com/)
  2. Run the following command in git bash: `git lfs install`
  3. Clone either the Gitlab or Bitbucket repository:
		`git clone https://bitbucket.di2e.net/projects/AFIT/repos/ASSET.git`
		`git clone https://gitlab.radiancetech.com/CTISR/ASSET.git`

## Documentation
Documentation can be found at:
  1. `[ASSET root directory]\docs\`
  2. https://gitlab.radiancetech.com/CTISR/ASSET/wikis/ (work in progress)

## Development
Development by users is encouraged. New features, bug fixes, or other improvements may be contributed by incorporating development in a new branch and pushing to either Gitlab or Bitbucket. For users not familiar with Git, modest changes may be provided via email.

## Tools
The `[ASSET root directory]\tools\` folder contains many functions not required to run ASSET but useful for post-processing and evaluating ASSET data in Matlab. These tools are mostly undocumented and provided without warranty. A limited description of several follows, and additional descriptions will be added to the Gitlab wiki.

`allax` -- return handles to all figure axes

`appendHDF5` (work in progress) -- `Runtime Save` field in the configuration file must be set to `TRUE`

`coadd` -- background suppression and signal averaging

`genConfig` -- generates an ASSET configuration file using a reference .cfg file and user-defined parameter values

`gpuReset` -- resetst the GPU

`histm` -- histogram of array

`index` -- extracts the specified index value from a vector or array

`interleaveFrames` -- `Save Frames` and `Save Arrays` must be set to `TRUE` in the configuration file.

`myimagesc` -- display an image with colorbar and caxis scaling

`play` -- animate ASSET `Frames`

`shover` -- display track `overlay`

`tover` -- generate track `overlay` from `Targets` data structure

`xscale` -- toggle between linear and log scale on the x-axis

`yscale` -- toggle between linear and log scale on the y-axis
